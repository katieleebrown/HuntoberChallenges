# HuntoberChallenges
A place to store my code for Huntober Challenges. You can checkout the list of challenges <a href='https://twitter.com/huntoberTweets'>here</a>.

# Why?
I'm working on honing my skills leading up to job application season. As I'm beginning the transition from CodeWars to Leetcode (you can find my Codewars repository <a href=''>here</a>), this is a great way to bridge the gap. I like starting off my morning with a quick challenge alongside my coffee, and this is my latest set of code.

# Tech Stack
These challenges are all written in Javascript. 

I have a (very) future goal of creating an HTML landing page that lets you test my functions with your own inputs.
